## Project Title

**Smart Contract for Fixed-Interest Loans**

---

## Project Description

This simple Solidity smart contract allows a lender to grant a fixed-interest loan to a borrower. The contract calculates the repayment amount (principal + interest) and provides a function for the borrower to repay the loan.

---

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to provide a basic yet effective framework for managing fixed-interest loans on the blockchain. By using this contract, the lender and borrower can engage in a trustless loan agreement, with all terms automatically enforced by the blockchain.

---

## Key Features

- **Loan Granting**: The lender deploys the contract, specifying the loan amount, interest rate, and the borrowerâ€™s address.
- **Repayment Function**: The borrower can repay the loan with a single function, and the loan is marked as repaid once the correct amount is paid.
- **Fixed Interest Rate**: The contract calculates the repayment amount based on a fixed interest rate and loan amount.
